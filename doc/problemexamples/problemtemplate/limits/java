# the idea is that this file will be executed by the autojudge in the first time the autojudge downloads a problem, so as it will be
# able to decide the proper time limit for the machine where it is running. If one wants to fix a predefined time limit, then it is
# enough to write a script like this one with the desired value. Otherwise, one can build any more sophisticated program that outputs
# the value.
